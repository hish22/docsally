## ðŸ“– Description

**Docsally** is a simple AI document reader that helps you understand and summarize PDFs easily. It uses Ollama to run local AI models, extracts content from PDF files, and turns it into smart vectors stored in a vector database. This allows you to ask questions and get quick, accurate answers based on your documents.

Docsally is built to be easy to useâ€”not complicated. More features will be added and improved in future updates to make your experience even better.
